            <div class="tooltip">How To Use!
                <span class="tooltiptext">Enable your camera (If you have zoom or some other application,
                    you will need to turn the camera off there for this to work). The face detection may
                    take a few seconds to load up so please give it a moment. Once you see your video feed,
                    you can play the game by pressing start. The bombs will do damage and take away score.
                    The red circle is an apple you can eat to heal health, however you can only eat it by
                    physically opening your mouth. The yellow circle is coins to increase your score. Play
                    until you get a high score! The way this works is by grabbing the facial points and
                    using that as the hurtbox to your character. So now you have to physically move your
                    face around to avoid and reach certain obstacles.
                </span>
                <!-- <span class="tooltiptext">Enable your camera (If you have zoom or some other application,
                    you will need to turn the camera off there for this to work). The face detection may
                    take a few seconds to load up so please give it a moment. Once you see your video feed,
                    you can interactively test some filters and animations with the buttons. Some filters
                    will have animations when you open your mouth or close your eyes. If you want to see
                    closed eyes animations, try squinting! Try winking too! If you would like to switch,
                    either click the same one to toggle it off or clear. Actually, some can be combined
                    depending on if they fit so test some of them together and see what happens! If you're
                    done playing with the filters, you can play the game by pressing start. The bombs will
                    do damage and take away score. The red circle is an apple you can eat to heal health.
